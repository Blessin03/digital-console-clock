# digital-console-clock
A C++ console clock with color and modular design 

# OVERVIEW
This Digital Console Clock is a simple, modular C++ program that displays real-time in a clean, zero-padded format with colorized output in the console. I built this project to practice modular class-based design, console handling with the Windows API, and formatting techniques using modern C++.
