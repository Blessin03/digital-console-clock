# Digital Console Clock

> A C++ console clock with color and class (modular) design.

## Overview

This **Digital Console Clock** is a simple, class-based C++ program that displays real time in your terminal. It features zero-padded formatting, colorized seconds. I built it to practice modular design, Windows console APIs, and modern C++ formatting techniques.

## Build Instructions

```bash
# From your project root:
g++  main.cpp clock.cpp -o clock.exe
